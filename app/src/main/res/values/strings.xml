    <string name="screen_brightness_text">\u2022 The display is one of the most important battery drain sources on mobile devices. Reducing its brightness can have a great impact on battery life. If you want automatic adjustments of the brightness level based on the environmental lighting, you can enable Adaptive Brightness.</string>
    <string name="screen_timeout_text">\u2022 A Screen Timeout value as small as possible is another way to save battery.</string>

    <string name="include_thread_count">Include thread count statistics (might significantly increase total session duration)</string>
    <string name="performance_governor_description">The \'performance\' governor keeps each core at its maximum available frequency at all times. It is suitable for computationally intensive tasks such as image editing or playing complex video games, but it may consume more power.</string>
    <string name="powersave_governor_description">The \'powersave\' governor keeps each core at its minimum available frequency at all times. While it is likely to reduce power consumption, the performance of the device might be strongly affected. It is suitable for tasks such as reading a PDF file.</string>
    <string name="ondemand_governor_description">The \'ondemand\' governor dynamically adjusts the CPU frequency based on the system load. It increases the frequency when the system is under heavy load and decreases it when the load decreases. It aims to balance performance and power consumption.</string>
    <string name="userspace_governor_description">The \'userspace\' governor allows users to manually set the CPU frequency of each core.</string>
    <string name="interactive_governor_description">The \'interactive\' governor controls the CPU frequency based on the detection of user interactions: it will quickly ramp up the frequency when user interactions are detected and will reduce the frequency when there are no interactions.</string>
    <string name="conservative_governor_description">The \'conservative\' governor dynamically adjusts the CPU frequency based on the system load. It gradually increases the frequency in response to increased load and decreases it slowly as the load decreases.</string>
    <string name="schedutil_governor_description">The \'schedutil\' governor uses information provided by the scheduler (another component of the Operating System) to make decisions about CPU frequency changes, such as predicting future workload demands and adjusting the frequency accordingly.</string>

    <string name="udfs_definition">\tUDFS (User Driven Frequency Scaling) is a method of finding the lowest CPU frequencies that still maintain satisfactory user experience.</string>
    <string name="udfs_explanation1">\tWhen you click the Start button below, this process starts by setting the frequency limits to their maximum values. There are 9 levels for frequency limits, and level 1 represents the minimum frequencies that the cores can operate at. You will receive a notification which allows you to interact with the Power Manager application. It will present two options:</string>
    <string name="udfs_explanation2">\tIf you are comfortable with the current user experience and want to continue the process, click on the Continue button and the level will decrease (the frequency limits will be lower). When you are no longer satisfied by the performance of your device, click on Stop and the previous frequency limits that you were comfortable with will be restored. You can then save them as a permanent configuration from the Control Screen of the Power Manager application.</string>
    <string name="udfs_note">\t! Note that lower CPU frequencies do not always result in extended battery life. You can check if that is the case using the power and performance recording feature.</string>
